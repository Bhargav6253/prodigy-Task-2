 ## Overview of the Project

 ### Project: IMPLEMENT CAESAR CIPHER
 
 ### Objective

The objective of this project is to implement the Caesar Cipher algorithm using Python to perform encryption and decryption of text. The project aims to help understand basic cryptographic concepts by shifting characters using a user-defined key.

### Key Activities

Studied the working principle of the Caesar Cipher

Designed logic for text encryption and decryption

Implemented character shifting using a shift value

Handled uppercase, lowercase, and non-alphabet characters

Tested the program with different input values

 ### Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python
Concepts: Cryptography basics, Caesar Cipher
Tools: Python Interpreter, VS Code / IDLE
Domain: Cyber Security
