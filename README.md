 ## Overview of the Project

 ### Project: IMPLEMENT CAESAR CIPHER
 
 ### Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a simple image encryption and decryption tool using pixel manipulation techniques. The project aims to demonstrate basic cybersecurity concepts by modifying pixel values of an image using a secret key, thereby ensuring data confidentiality and understanding the fundamentals of image-based encryption.

### Key Activities

Studied the concept of image encryption using pixel manipulation
Designed encryption and decryption logic based on a secret key
Implemented pixel value modification using Python and Pillow library
Developed functions to encrypt and decrypt images
Tested the program with different key values and images
Verified successful recovery of the original image after decryption

 ### Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python
Library: Pillow (PIL) for image processing
Tools: Python Interpreter, VS Code / IDLE
Domain: Cyber Security
Concepts: Image Processing, Pixel Manipulation, Encryption & Decryption
